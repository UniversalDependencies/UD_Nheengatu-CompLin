# Summary

The UD_Nheengatu-CompLin is a treebank of [Nheengatu](https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/nhen1239), also known, e.g., as Modern Tupi and *Língua Geral Amazônica*. It comprises sentences from diverse published sources, e.g., grammatical descriptions, coursebooks, and dictionaries.


# Introduction

To our knowledge, this is the first treebank of Nheengatu. It is a work in progress. The initial release only contains a few dozen sentences. However, we plan to include some hundred new sentences in the next few months.

The treebank comprises sentences from diverse published sources freely available on the Internet, e.g., grammatical descriptions, coursebooks, and dictionaries. The sentences were either extracted from PDF text files or manually converted to orthography from phonetic transcriptions. Throughout the treebank, we use the spelling system of Navarro (2016), which only contains minor differences from Avila (2021)'s. The annotation was performed semi-automatically, i.e., we applied a Python program to the output of a morphological analyzer, manually revising each automatically annotated sentence.

The development of this treebank and related tools and resources are part of the research activities of the Research Group on Computation and Natural Language (*Computação e Linguagem Natural* — CompLin) at the Humanities Center of the Federal University of Ceará in Brazil.

So far, the treebank includes examples from Moore, Facundes, and Pires (1994), Cruz (2011), Navarro (2016), Alencar (2021), and Avila (2021).

# Acknowledgments

We are grateful to Eduardo de Almeida Navarro (University of São Paulo) for kindly allowing us to use examples and texts from his coursebook (Navarro 2016) in this project. Besides, the glossary of this coursebook was the basis for the morphological analyzer.

We also acknowledge the use of Avila (2021)'s dictionary, from which numerous treebank sentences stem. This dictionary also provided invaluable lexical, grammatical, and semantic information for the construction of the morphological analyzer and related annotation tools.
