# Summary

The UD_Nheengatu-CompLin is a treebank of [Nheengatu]([url](https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/nhen1239)), also known, e.g., as Modern Tupi and *Língua Geral Amazônica*. It comprises sentences from diverse published sources, e.g., grammatical descriptions, coursebooks, and dictionaries. 


# Introduction

To our knowledge, this is the first treebank of Nheengatu. It is a work in progress. The initial release only contains a few dozen sentences. However, we plan to include some hundred new sentences in the next few months.
The treebank comprises sentences from diverse published sources freely available on the Internet, e.g., grammatical descriptions, coursebooks, and dictionaries. The sentences were either manually converted to orthography from phonetic transcriptions or extracted from PDF text files. Throughout the treebank, we use the spelling system of Navarro (2016), which only contains minor differences from Avila (2021)'s. The annotation was performed semi-automatically, i.e., we applied a Python program to the output of a morphological analyzer, manually revising each automatic annotated sentence.
The development of this treebank and the corresponding tools and resources is part of the research activities of the Research Group on Computation and Natural Language (*Computação e Linguagem Natural* — CompLin) at the Humanities Center of the Federal University of Ceará in Brazil. For more information, please visit the corresponding repository:

So far, the treebank includes examples from Moore, Facundes, and Pires (1994), Navarro (2016), and Alencar (2021).
